blurglowdemo,The shader takes a sprite and blurs it in two passes. It uses this blurred texture as a mask that feeds into the MainView's shader. The MainView applies a glow around the character.
advancedtoondemo,"This advanced toon shader gives fine control over specular, anisotropy, color masks, shadow, and light colors."
blurviewportcontainersdemo,"Uses ViewportContainers to compose a scene that uses Gaussian blur as motion blur. The ship is in a separate viewport, so it's not affected by the motion blur."
blurviewporttexturesdemo,Uses TextureRects to compose a scene that uses Gaussian blur as motion blur. It's an alternative setup to produce a result like BlurViewportContainers.
clouds2ddemo,Use noise and texture scrolling to add shadows cast by overhead clouds to your world.
crystaldemo,We converted a SpatialMaterial to a shader to add a TIME-based pulse effect to its emission and fresnel.
dissolve2ddemo,"We use a Noise mask to dissolve a sprite and generate a mask used to set the emission points array of a CPUParticles2D. To generate the particles mask, we scale down the dissolve mask in ScaledView and loop over that texture's pixels in GDScript."
dissolve3ddemo,We use a noise mask to make a 3D object dissolve by reducing the alpha channel of the Mesh according to the shape of the noise texture.
environmentglowdemo,We can create a glow effect on 2D objects with a built-in WorldEnvironment node rather than creating a solution with shaders.
flag3ddemo,"To give the impression of a flag blowing in the wind, our shader samples, and scrolls OpenSimplexNoise to displace the vertices of our Mesh."
forcefielddemo,Our force field emitter uses a fresnel effect to form a smooth glow and the depth buffer to calculate intersection with existing world geometry.
impossiblecubedemo,"We use a viewport to simulate stencil tests, making objects disappear depending on what color is facing the camera on the stencil view. The stencil supports up to 7 colors of masks."
interactivesnowdemo,We paint a trail in a secondary viewport. A shader then reads that to decide where to displace and blend the textures of the snow into the dirt where it is trodden.
invertedcolorsdemo,"This shader takes the colors output by the demo viewport and inverts them - white is black, blue isn't blue, not red is red, etc."
matcapdemo,This shader applies a material capture texture. It maps a sphere texture using the model's normals instead of UVs. So any normals that point to the right sample from the texture's right.
noisedemo,"Several common types of random noise, selecting the proper noise to shape your shaders is a key step in creating appealing effects. "
outline2ddemo,"Shaders are excellent for the not-so-easy task of outlining 2D sprites - outlining only outside the pixels, inside, or both."
outline3ddemo,"Shaders can also outline 3D objects with precise control. We effectively draw the meshes a second time, but bigger, and invert the culling to draw behind the object."
paletteswap2ddemo,"Shaders are excellent at simple recoloring tasks. Our sprite is made grayscale, and we use the shade of gray to select colors from a palette. We can even support multiple color palettes, selecting them with a palette_index parameter."
particlebridgedemo,Particles can be shaders too! This demo shows how to communicate between a particle and material shader for complex effects with many moving parts.
pixelperfectoutlinedemo,"An outline drawn in clip space instead of vertex space. Its width is specified in pixels and remains at a constant size regardless of the distance from the camera or the scale of the object. Good for user interfaces, object highlights, and technical drawings."
pointilismdemo,"Turns the color data from the demo viewport into a black and white image, and uses the step function in a shader to turn it into a pointilism image."
prebakedglowdemo,"Uses a shader on a sprite to control a glow. The glow effect is part of the sprite's texture, and the shader manipulates the amount of alpha and color intensity."
reflection2ddemo,Vertical mirror shader with a fade to a background color. This demo shows how to create a pure vertical mirror using the screen texture. You can control the way the reflection fade using a gradient texture.
reflection2dtexturerectdemo,Vertical mirror shader with a fade to a background color. This demo shows how to create a pure vertical mirror using the screen texture. You can control the way the reflection fade using a gradient texture.
shockwave3ddemo,"Press Enter to launch a shockwave. Uses a vertex shader to propagate a spherical shockwave through the geometry, instead of as a post-process effect."
shockwavedemo,"Uses a shader to generate a torus, black and white mask, the data of which is used to distort the UVs of the demo viewports to make a shockwave heat distortion effect."
spheremaskdemo,A spherical mask is applied to the bridge to make it disappear when too far from a given point (the lantern). Bridge model from: https://blendswap.com/blend/23063
stylizedfiredemo,"A particle system with a custom world coordinate, noise based, alpha erosion."
stylizedliquiddemo,Stylized liquid in a bottle. The liquid uses a custom shader and a custom script that informs the liquid shader when movement happens. Note that the origin of  the liquid mesh should be placed roughly in the center of the liquid.
stylizedwaterfalldemo,"This demo shows how to create a stylized waterfall. In particular, this waterfall is created by leveraging UVs and vertex colors created in the modeling software (blender). Because we are using carefully crafted UVs, we don't need to use flowmaps."
texturemixdemo,"A shader that mixes albedo and normal textures based on different parameters. From left to right: mix based on red channel for vertex color, mix based on ambient occlusion map, and mix based on world space normal. model by https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/western-stylised-rock-24c821bbe0a1469ba66b9d5894546d9a"
unlitdirectionaltintdemo,"An unlit shader that tints the model depending on the world normal. Unlit tint shader on the left, regular shader with albedo on the right"
water2ddemo,Example of a 2D water. The diffuse color texture has no light information. The shadows are calculated in the shader. You can use the [code]modulate[/code] property to tint the water.
water3ddemo,A water shader that uses the depth buffer and the color buffer to cause a stylized refraction effect. Intersections are highlighted with foam using the depth buffer.
watersidescroll2ddemo,Water for a side-scrolling game. Builds upon Reflection2DDemo.tscn. The Water2DSideSimple node uses a simpler shader than Water2DSide to help you understand the basics:  moving and offsetting the water's surface using a texture and the TIME variable.
windgrassdemo,A wind shader that uses MultiMesh to create the blades of grass and a noise texture for the wind. This shader also supports one character interacting with the grass.
xray2ddemo,Generates a black and white mask that determines where color information from the XRay view should override color information from the Main view.
xray3ddemo,Generates a black and white mask that determines where color information from the XRay view should override color information from the Main view. The XRay view is a glowing fresnel effect.
