blurglowdemo,"Takes a sprite with a flat color and blurs it in two passes: Blur1, Blur2. This blurred texture is used as a mask (MaskView), which is fed into the MainView's shader. The MainView applies the glow around the character."
advancedtoondemo,"An advanced toon shader that gives fine control over specular, anisotropy, color masks, shadow and light colors."
blurviewportcontainersdemo,Uses ViewportContainers to compose a scene that uses gaussian blur as motion blur. The ship is in its own viewport so it's not affected by the motion blur. The motion blur happens in BlurView and BlurView2.
blurviewporttexturesdemo,Uses TextureRects to compose a scene that uses gaussian blur as motion blur. It's an alternative setup to produce a result like BlurViewportContainersDemo.tscn.
clouds2ddemo,Use noise and texture scrolling to add shadows cast by overhead clouds to your world.
crystaldemo,An otherwise standard material that has been converted to a shader to add a TIME based pulse effect to its emission and fresnel.
dissolve2ddemo,"Uses a Noise mask to dissolve a sprite. Also generates a mask that is use to set the emission points array of a CPUParticles2D. To generate the particles mask, we scale down the dissolve mask (ScaledView) and loop over that texture's pixels in GDScript (CPUParticles2D)."
dissolve3ddemo,Uses a noise mask to make a 3D object dissolve.
environmentglowdemo,Achieves a glow on 2D objects with a WorldEnvironment node.
flag3ddemo,The shader samples OpenSimplexNoise to give the impression of a flag blowing in the wind.
forcefielddemo,"Press Enter to launch a force field emitter. It uses a fresnel effect to form a smooth glow, and the depth buffer to calculate intersection with existing world geometry."
impossiblecubedemo,"Uses viewports to simulate stencil tests, making objects disappear depending on what color is facing the camera on the stencil view. The stencil supports up to 7 colors of masks."
interactivesnowdemo,"A trail is painted in a secondary viewport, that is then read by a shader to do displacement and texture blending."
invertedcolorsdemo,"Takes the colors output by the demo viewport and inverts the colors - white is black, blue is red, etc."
matcapdemo,A shader that applies a material capture texture. A texture of a sphere that is mapped using the model's normals instead of its UVs. So normals pointing to the right sample from the right of the texture. 
noisedemo,Several types of random noise. Shader code and fantastic explanations provided by Gonkee (https://github.com/Gonkee/)
outline2ddemo,"Uses shaders to outline 2D sprites - outlining only outside the pixels, inside, or both."
outline3ddemo,"Uses shaders to draw an outline around 3D object highlighted by the mouse, effectively drawing them a second time, but bigger, and inverting the culling so it draws behind the object."
paletteswap2ddemo,Press ANY button to cycle through color palettes. Sprite itself is converted to even distribution of gray tones from black to white. Color sets are laid on texture vertically with colors spread horizontally. Shader reads color value from one color channel and uses the value as a horizontal position value on the color set. Using palette_index to offset vertical position and achieving different color sets.
particlebridgedemo,Particle bridge! This demo shows how to communicate between a particle shader and a canvas_item/spatial shader.
pixelperfectoutlinedemo,"An outline drawn in clip space instead of vertex space. Its width is specified in pixels and remains at a constant size regardless of the distance from the camera or the scale of the object. Good for user interfaces, object highlights, and technical drawings."
pointilismdemo,"Turns the color data from the demo viewport into a black and white image, and uses the step function in a shader to turn it into a pointilism image."
prebakedglowdemo,"Uses a shader on a sprite to control a glow. The glow effect is part of the sprite's texture, and the shader manipulates the amount of alpha and color intensity."
reflection2ddemo,Vertical mirror shader with a fade to a background color. This demo shows how to create a pure vertical mirror using the screen texture. You can control the way the reflection fade using a gradient texture.
reflection2dtexturerectdemo,Vertical mirror shader with a fade to a background color. This demo shows how to create a pure vertical mirror using the screen texture. You can control the way the reflection fade using a gradient texture.
shockwave3ddemo,"Press Enter to launch a shockwave. Uses a vertex shader to propagate a spherical shockwave through the geometry, instead of as a post-process effect."
shockwavedemo,"Uses a shader to generate a torus, black and white mask, the data of which is used to distort the UVs of the demo viewports to make a shockwave heat distortion effect."
spheremaskdemo,A spherical mask is applied to the bridge to make it disappear when too far from a given point (the lantern). Bridge model from: https://blendswap.com/blend/23063
stylizedfiredemo,"A particle system with a custom world coordinate, noise based, alpha erosion."
stylizedliquiddemo,Stylized liquid in a bottle. The liquid uses a custom shader and a custom script that informs the liquid shader when movement happens. Note that the origin of  the liquid mesh should be placed roughly in the center of the liquid.
stylizedwaterfalldemo,"This demo shows how to create a stylized waterfall. In particular, this waterfall is created by leveraging UVs and vertex colors created in the modeling software (blender). Because we are using carefully crafted UVs, we don't need to use flowmaps."
texturemixdemo,"A shader that mixes albedo and normal textures based on different parameters. From left to right: mix based on red channel for vertex color, mix based on ambient occlusion map, and mix based on world space normal. model by https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/western-stylised-rock-24c821bbe0a1469ba66b9d5894546d9a"
unlitdirectionaltintdemo,"An unlit shader that tints the model depending on the world normal. Unlit tint shader on the left, regular shader with albedo on the right"
water2ddemo,Example of a 2D water. The diffuse color texture has no light information. The shadows are calculated in the shader. You can use the [code]modulate[/code] property to tint the water.
water3ddemo,A water shader that uses the depth buffer and the color buffer to cause a stylized refraction effect. Intersections are highlighted with foam using the depth buffer.
watersidescroll2ddemo,Water for a side-scrolling game. Builds upon Reflection2DDemo.tscn. The Water2DSideSimple node uses a simpler shader than Water2DSide to help you understand the basics:  moving and offsetting the water's surface using a texture and the TIME variable.
windgrassdemo,A wind shader that uses MultiMesh to create the blades of grass and a noise texture for the wind. This shader also supports one character interacting with the grass.
xray2ddemo,Generates a black and white mask that determines where color information from the XRay view should override color information from the Main view.
xray3ddemo,Generates a black and white mask that determines where color information from the XRay view should override color information from the Main view. The XRay view is a glowing fresnel effect.
